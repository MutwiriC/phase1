**Overview**

This project analyzes aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft and operational practices for our company's expansion into the aviation industry. Using data from 77,488 aviation accidents spanning 1962-2023, we provide data-driven recommendations for aircraft selection and safety protocols.

**Business Understanding**
Stakeholder: Head of Aviation Division

**Key Business Questions:**

Which aircraft categories and manufacturers have the best safety records?
What operational phases pose the highest risks to aviation safety?
How can we minimize risks when starting our aviation operations?
Which aircraft should we prioritize for purchase and operation?

**Data Understanding and Analysis**
Data Source: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation Accident Database
Time Period: 1962-2023
Total Records: 77,488 analyzed accidents after data cleaning
Key Variables: Aircraft category, manufacturer, flight phase, injury severity, weather conditions

Data Description: The dataset includes comprehensive information about civil aviation accidents in the United States and international waters, covering aircraft specifications, accident circumstances, and injury outcomes.


Based on our analysis of 77,488 aviation accidents, we recommend:

1. **Aircraft Selection**: Start with Airplane category aircraft (21.1% fatality rate) for the best balance of safety and operational experience
2. **Manufacturer Partnerships**: Partner with Boeing and Airbus, which have the best safety records among major manufacturers  
3. **Operational Safety**: Focus pilot training on descent and other high-risk flight phases where fatality rates exceed 90%
